# Concentration-of-Banking



## Goal
Quantifying the concentration/decentralization/equilibrium of banking as a property of monopoly capitalism from 2003-2023 by seeing trends in consolidated assets of large commercial banks.

## Description
Concentration of banking, as a property of monopoly capitalism, is the tendency of capital centralizing more and more around a few financial institutions, creating a financial network where a small number of banks and industrial monopolies wield anormous power over production (or under-production), investment (or lack of it), and commerce (or its stultification). It subordinates the separated regional economies of a society into a singularity. 


## Methodology

b) Animated pie chart: I used the [SJ Visualizer]([url](https://www.sjdataviz.com/software)) package to display the changes in the percentage dominance of the consolidated assets of the biggest 7 banks.

c) Interactive line plot: I used Plotly's line plots to observe the two decate trend in the accumulation of consolidated assets by the biggest 7 banks in the magnitude of their dollar value.
